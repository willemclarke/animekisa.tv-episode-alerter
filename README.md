## animekisa.tv episode alterter

- little project to introduce myself to web scraping some data
- uses animes from animekisa.tv to pull episode data and send an email using nodemailer when a new episode is released

### if you would like to use:

- clone the repository --> npm install
- depending on which anime you want to add, navigate to the index.js folder and adjust the 'animes' object data --> make sure to use animekisa.tv site
- update the email-handling.js file to contain the emails you wish to use and send --> I sent to myself
